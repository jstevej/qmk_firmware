## Bootloader

Enter the bootloader in 3 ways:

* **Bootmagic reset**: Hold down the key at (0,0) in the matrix (usually the top left key or Escape) and plug in the keyboard
* **Physical reset button**: Quickly double-tap the reset button on the back of the PCB. This assumes you are using a [0xcb Helios](https://github.com/0xCB-dev/0xCB-Helios) as your MCU.
* **Keycode in layout**: Press the key mapped to `QK_BOOT` if it is available
